# SyncIt Playground

This is the original demo application for SyncIt. It enables you to easily see what's going on with the internals of SyncIt and understand why it does certain things. There is however a [better example application here](https://github.com/forbesmyester/SyncItTodoMvc) of how to make fully fledged application because it includes extra components, such as a basic server and connection monitoring.
